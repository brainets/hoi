HOI jax implementation
======================

Description
+++++++++++
The estimation of **Higher-Order Interactions (HOIs)** involves various approaches from diverse fields, such as graph theory and information theory. One notable information-theoretical quantity used in this context is the O-information, which stands for **Information about Organizational structure.**

The O-information is a powerful tool for characterizing statistical interdependencies within multiplets of three or more variables. It goes beyond simply quantifying the amount of information carried by brain regions' multiplets; it also provides valuable insights into the nature of this information. Specifically, the O-information informs us about whether the multiplets predominantly convey redundant or synergistic information among the interconnected brain regions.

In summary, this package aims at calculating the O-information thereby understanding and deciphering complex interactions among multiple brain regions, shedding light on the underlying organizational structure and the type of information exchanges taking place within these multiplets.
