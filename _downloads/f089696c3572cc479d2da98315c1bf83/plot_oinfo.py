This example illustrates how to use the O-information and how it's linked to
other metrics such as the Total Correlation (TC), the Dual Total Correlation
(DTC), the S-Information and the gradient O-information. We recommend reading

# Data simulation
# ---------------
#
# Let's first simulate some data to showcase the different metrics. Here, we
# are going to simulate a network of 6 nodes, then we introduce redudancy
# between nodes (0, 1, 2) and synergy between nodes (3, 4, 5). For further
# information about how to simulate redundant and synergistic interactions,
# checkout the example
# :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_tutorials_plot_sim_red_syn.py`

# network of 6 nodes and 1000 samples each
x = np.random.rand(1000, 6)

# inject redundancy between nodes (0, 1, 2)
x[:, 1] += x[:, 0]
x[:, 2] += x[:, 0]

# inject synergy between nodes (3, 4, 5)
x[:, 3] += x[:, 4] + x[:, 5]

# O-information for network behavior
# ----------------------------------
#
# The O-information is a multivariate measure of information capable of
# disentangling whether a subset of a variable X tend to have synergistic or
# redundant interactions. The O-information is defined as the difference
# between two quantities, the Total Correlation (TC) and Dual Total Correlation
# (DTC).
#
# Total Correlation (TC)
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# The TC is defined as :
#
# .. math::
#     TC(X^{n}) = \sum_{j=1}^{n} H(X_{j}) - H(X^{n})
#
# To give an intuition about the TC, the :math:`\sum_{j=1}^{n} H(X_{j})`
# quantifies the amount of information carried by individual nodes in a system
# while :math:`H(X^{n})` also contains the information carried by individual
# node plus their interactions. Then, by taking the subtraction between the two
# quantities we isolate the information contains in the interactions. That's
# why the TC quantifies the strength of the "collective constraints" which is
# related to redundancy.

# compute hoi using TC :
model = TC(x)
hoi = model.fit(method="gc", minsize=3, maxsize=3)

# get the multiplets with largest values of hoi
print(get_nbest_mult(hoi, model))

# %%
# As we can see from the table above, the TC found the multiplet (0, 1, 2),
# defined as a redundant triplet with the largest value.

# %%
# Dual Total Correlation (DTC)
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# The DTC is defined as :
#
# .. math::
#     DTC(X^{n}) = H(X^{n}) - \sum_{j=1}^{n} H(X_j|X_{-j}^{n})
#
# Again, the DTC is also defined as the difference between two terms. The first
# one, :math:`H(X^{n})`, just as in the TC, quantifies the amount of
# information of the whole system (i.e. the information of individual nodes and
# their interactions). To this quantity, we subtract the term
# :math:`\sum_{j=1}^{n} H(X_j|X_{-j}^{n})` which represents the sum of
# information of individual nodes (:math:`\sum_{j=1}^{n} H(X_j)`) to which we
# remove the influence of all other nodes except the one concerned
# (:math:`|X_{-j}^{n}`). Said differently, this conditioning allows to isolate
# the intrinsic entropy of each node :math:`X_{j}` that is not shared with
# others. Consequently, this difference isolates the "shared randomness" which
# is linked to the synergy.


# compute hoi using DTC :
model = DTC(x)
hoi = model.fit(method="gc", minsize=3, maxsize=3)

# get the multiplets with largest values of hoi
print(get_nbest_mult(hoi, model))

# %%
# This time, the DTC finds the triplet (3, 4, 5) as the one with the largest
# value of HOI and it's normal because this triplet is synergistic and the DTC
# is related to synergy.

# %%
# O-information
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# Finally, the O-information is defined as the difference between the TC and
# DTC. As both quantities are respectively linked to redundancy and synergy,
# the O-information is going to be positive when a system is dominated by
# redundant interactions and negative when the system is dominated by
# synergistic interactions. The mathematical definition of the O-information is
# given by :
#
# .. math::
#     \Omega(X^{n})  &=  TC(X^{n}) - DTC(X^{n}) \\
#                    &=  (n - 2)H(X^{n}) + \sum_{j=1}^{n} [H(X_{j}) - H(
#                         X_{-j}^{n})]
#

# compute hoi using the O-information :
model = Oinfo(x)
hoi = model.fit(method="gc", minsize=3, maxsize=3)

# get the multiplets with largest values of hoi
print(get_nbest_mult(hoi, model))

# %%
# Finally, the O-information isolates the triplet (0, 1, 2) as the one with the
# largest positive, redundant, hoi and the triplet (3, 4, 5) as the one with
# the smallest, negative and therefore synergistic multiplet.

# %%
# S-information
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# Finally, the S-information is defined as the sum of the TC and DTC :

# .. math::
#     \Omega(X^{n})  &=  TC(X^{n}) + DTC(X^{n}) \\
#                    &=  nH(X^{n}) + \sum_{j=1}^{n} [H(X_{j}) + H(
#                    X_{-j}^{n})]

# compute hoi using the S-information :
model = Sinfo(x)
hoi = model.fit(method="gc", minsize=3, maxsize=3)

# get the multiplets with largest values of hoi
print(get_nbest_mult(hoi, model))

# %%
# The S-info isolates the two triplets (0, 1, 2) and (3, 4, 5), even if both
# have different characters (redundant and synergistic)

# O-information for network encoding
# ----------------------------------
#
# The previous section focused on network behavior, i.e. characterizing the
# type of interactions between the elements of a system. But what if we want
# now to add a target variable, i.e. ask the question whether a multiplet is
# carrying redundant or synergistic information **about** a target variable
# :math:`Y`. Intuitively, we could quantify the difference between the
# information carried by all of the nodes :math:`X_{j}` with target minus the
# information of all of the nodes without the target. This is the idea behind
# the gradient O-information, defined as the difference between the two
# O-information :
#
# .. math::
#     \partial_{i}\Omega(X^{n}) &= \Omega(X^{n}) - \Omega(X^{n}_{-i}) \\
#                                 &= (2 - n)I(X_{i}; X^{n}_{-i}) + \sum_{
#                                 k=1, k\neq i}^{n} I(X_{k}; X^{n}_{-ik})

# %%
# Simulating redundant encoding
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# To simulate redundant encoding, we send a copy of :math:`Y` to the nodes
# (0, 1, 2)

# network of 6 nodes and 1000 samples each
x = np.random.rand(1000, 6)

# target variable
y = np.random.rand(1000)

# redundancy between nodes (0, 1, 2) about y
x[:, 0] += y
x[:, 1] += y
x[:, 2] += y

# compute gradient o-info :
model = GradientOinfo(x, y)
hoi = model.fit(method="gc", minsize=3, maxsize=3)

# get the multiplets with largest values of hoi
print(get_nbest_mult(hoi, model, n_best=3))

# %%
# The gradient O-info retrieved redundant interactions between nodes (0, 1, 2)
# about :math:`Y`

# %%
# Simulating synergistic encoding
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# To simulate synergistic encoding, :math:`Y` is going to be defined as the sum
# between nodes (3, 4, 5)

# network of 6 nodes and 1000 samples each
x = np.random.rand(1000, 6)

# synergy between nodes (3, 4, 5) about y
y = x[:, 3] + x[:, 4] + x[:, 5]

# compute gradient o-info :

hoi = model.fit(method="gc", minsize=3, maxsize=3)

# get the multiplets with largest values of hoi
print(get_nbest_mult(hoi, model, n_best=3))

# %%
# The gradient O-info retrieved synergistic interactions between nodes
# (3, 4, 5) about :math:`Y`

# %%
# Combining redundant and synergistic codings using a multivariate target
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

# network of 6 nodes and 1000 samples each
x = np.random.rand(1000, 6)

# define a bivariate target variable
y = np.random.rand(1000, 2)

# redundancy between nodes (0, 1, 2) about the first column of y
x[:, 0] += y[:, 0]
x[:, 1] += y[:, 0]
x[:, 2] += y[:, 0]

# synergy between nodes (3, 4, 5) about the second column of y
y[:, 1] += x[:, 3] + x[:, 4] + x[:, 5]

# compute gradient o-info :
model = GradientOinfo(x, y)
hoi = model.fit(method="gc", minsize=3, maxsize=3)

# get the multiplets with largest values of hoi

# %%
# The gradient O-info retrieved the redundant interactions between (0, 1, 2)
# and synergistic interactions between (3, 4, 5) about :math:`Y`.


# %%
# Dynamic redundant and synergistic codings
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# Finally, we can compute the O-information and Gradient O-information on
# dynamic data

# network of 6 nodes, 1000 samples each and a 100 time points
x = np.random.rand(1000, 4, 100)

# define a dynamic target variable
y = np.random.rand(1000, 1, 100)

# define a hanning window
win = np.hanning(30)

# redundancy between nodes (0, 1, 2) about :math:`Y` between samples [20, 50]
x[:, 0, 20:50] += y[:, 0, 20:50] * win
x[:, 1, 20:50] += y[:, 0, 20:50] * win
x[:, 2, 20:50] += y[:, 0, 20:50] * win

# synergy between nodes (1, 2, 3) about :math:`Y` between samples [50, 80]
y[:, 0, 50:80] += (x[:, 1, 50:80] + x[:, 2, 50:80] + x[:, 3, 50:80]) * win
